\section{Model selection}

We tried severall models: linear regression, K-nearest neightbors (KNN), multi-layer perceptron and a random forest. For each model except the linear regression, we choosed to tweak severall well chosen hyperparameters and used a searching algorithm along with cross-validation to find the best hyperparameters for each model. A common searching algorithm is \textit{Grid Search} that will test every possible combination of hyperparameters. However, it can be computationaly intensive and another approach is to use \textit{Random Search} that will randomly select a combination of hyperparameters among the ones defined. Looking at the result of the random search, we can identify the area where the results are promising, tighten our ranges and perform a random search again. Although this algorithm being less computationaly intensive, it can be time consuming of running and running again the random search to find the best set of hyperparameters. A third approach and the one we tried in this project is to perform a \textit{Bayesian Search} which is basically similar to random search but...
