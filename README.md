## Libraries
For this project, we use basic datascience python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`,... that are already installed with `conda`. 

We use `category_encoders` package that implements a set of transformers for encoding categorical variables into numeric.
```bash 
$ conda install -c conda-forge category_encoders
```

We also use `scikit-optimize` package that implements Bayesian Search
```bash 
$ conda install -c conda-forge scikit-optimize
```
